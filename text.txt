'''Planks'''{{fn|Known as '''Planks''' {{in|java}} and '''Wood Planks''' {{in|bedrock}}.}} are common [[block]]s used in [[crafting]] recipes and are also the first thing that a [[player]] can craft in [[survival mode]] and [[adventure mode]]. Two categories of planks can be differentiated: flammable '''Overworld Planks''' made from [[tree]] logs, and nonflammable '''Nether Planks''' made from [[huge fungus|fungi]] stems.

== Obtaining ==

=== Breaking ===

Planks can be broken by hand, but using an [[axe]] speeds up the process.

=== Natural generation ===

; {{BlockSprite|Oak Planks|text=Oak}}
Oak planks generate as part of:
* [[Mineshaft]]s, where they are used as beams supported by oak [[fence]]s and as a platform where [[air]] is beneath.
* [[Plains]] [[village]]s, where they are used for various structures including walls, roofs, and floors of many buildings, as well as paths over [[water]].
* [[Stronghold]]s, where they are used for floors and pillars in the library and storage rooms.
* [[Woodland mansion]]s
* [[Shipwreck]]s


; {{BlockSprite|Spruce Planks|text=Spruce}}
Spruce planks generate as part of: 
* [[Swamp hut]]s, where they are used as a primary building material. 
* [[Taiga]], [[Snowy tundra]], and [[Snowy taiga]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}} villages, as a part of several buildings.
* [[Underwater ruins]]
* [[Shipwreck]]s


; {{BlockSprite|Birch Planks|text=Birch}}
Birch planks generate as part of: 
* [[Woodland mansion]]s
* [[Shipwreck]]s
* [[Pillager outpost]]s


; {{BlockSprite|Jungle Planks|text=Jungle}}
Jungle planks generate as part of:
* [[Shipwreck]]s


; {{BlockSprite|Acacia Planks|text=Acacia}} 
Acacia planks generate as part of: 
* [[Savanna]] villages
* [[Shipwreck]]s{{only|bedrock|short=1}}


; {{BlockSprite|Dark oak Planks|text=Dark oak}} 
Dark oak planks generate as part of:
* [[Mineshaft]]s generated in [[badlands]] biomes
* [[Woodland mansion]]s
* [[Underwater ruins]]
* [[Shipwreck]]s
* [[Pillager outpost]]s

== Usage ==

[[File:Planks Chart.png|thumb|The different colors of wood planks. From left to right, there are: oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia, dark oak, crimson, and warped.]]

Planks can be used for building structures, as crafting ingredients, and as fuel.

=== Crafting ingredient ===

Planks are used in many crafting recipes. [[Door]]s, [[fence]]s, [[fence gate]]s, [[slab]]s, [[stairs]], [[boat]]s, [[trapdoor]]s, [[pressure plate]]s, and [[button]]s must be crafted from planks of the same type, and the crafted result depends on the type used. For other products, planks of different types can be mixed freely and the wood types in the product is indeterminate.

{{crafting usage|Planks,Overworld Planks,Nether Planks,Oak Planks,Spruce Planks,Birch Planks,Jungle Planks,Acacia Planks,Dark Oak Planks,Crimson Planks,Warped Planks|match=end}}

=== Fuel ===

[[Overworld]] planks can be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, [[smelting]] 1.5 [[item]]s per [[block]]. [[Nether]] planks (crimson and warped planks) cannot be used as [[fuel]].

=== Repairing ===

Planks are the repair items for the wood [[tier]], and thus can be used to [[item repair|repair]] the following items in an [[anvil]]:
* {{ItemLink|Wooden sword}}
* {{ItemLink|Wooden pickaxe}}
* {{ItemLink|Wooden axe}}
* {{ItemLink|Wooden shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Wooden hoe}}

=== Block data ===
{{see also|Data values}}

{{IN|be}}, wood planks use the following data values:

{{/DV}}

If a [[command]] is used to create planks with data value 6 or higher, the resulting planks have the data value 0 (oak planks).

Note: unlike in other editions, the names for wood planks (as listed with tooltips in the player's inventory and in the recipe book) in Bedrock Edition actually read "[wood type] Wood Planks," e.g. "Dark Oak Wood Planks." This was previously the case in other versions of the game but was changed in [[Java Edition 17w47a]], and subsequently{{When}} was changed in Pocket Edition to match.

== Issues ==

{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Many items crafted using planks or sticks have textures that most resemble oak planks, regardless of the species used to craft them. On the other hand, [[item frame]]s and [[fletching table]]s resemble birch planks, [[cartography table]]s resemble dark oak planks, [[barrel]]s resemble spruce planks, while [[smithing table]]s resemble crimson planks.
* Crimson Planks and Warped Planks do not naturally generate, and are only available if [[crafted]] by a player.
