'''Slabs''', sometimes erroneously referred to as '''half-slabs''', are half-height versions of their respective [[blocks]].

== Obtaining ==

=== Breaking ===

Stone-type slabs and smooth blocks require a pickaxe to mine. Wooden slabs can be mined with anything, but an axe is quickest.

Most slabs drop themselves when broken. The exception is petrified oak slabs, which drop normal oak slabs.{{only|bedrock}}

Double slabs drop 2 of their respective single slabs, even when mined with Silk Touch. {{IN|java}}, double slabs are completely unobtainable.{{IN|bedrock}}, they can be obtained through inventory editing.

== Usage ==

=== Placement ===

Slabs can occupy either the top half or the bottom half of a block, or both:
* Placing a slab on top of a [[block]] or on the side of a block in the lower half of the side surface creates a bottom slab
* Placing a slab on the underside of a block or on the top half of the side surface creates a top slab
* Placing a top and bottom slab of the same type in the same block creates a double slab block
* It's impossible to place two different kinds of slabs in the same block.

Slabs cannot be oriented vertically.

=== Crafting ingredient ===

{{crafting usage|Slab|match=end}}

=== Behavior ===
[[File:Upside-downRedstone.png|right|thumb|200px|An example of how top slabs can make redstone travel compactly "up stairs".]]
[[File:Redstoneless Slab.png|200px|thumb|Slabs do not block a vertical redstone connection as it is a transparent block.]]

Generally, the top face of top slabs, the bottom face of bottom slabs, and all faces of double slabs are handled as solid blocks. Due to this, transparent blocks that need to placed on an opaque surface can be placed on these faces.

Double slabs are handled as a single block instead of two different slabs; as such, breaking one destroys the whole block and drop two slabs, as opposed to breaking only one slab within the block. "Double slabs" that are not aligned to the grid (i.e. a bottom slab on top of a top slab) are handled as separate blocks and are broken individually.

Redstone dust placed on a top slab receives signals from redstone dust one block lower and adjacent, but cannot transmit signals down to that block.

[[Mob]]s see a slab as a full block. Mobs can spawn on top slabs and double slabs, but not on bottom slabs. {{IN|bedrock}}, [[iron golem]]s do not spawn even on a top slab.{{verify|This seems to have changed since 1.11; top slabs don't seem prevent iron golems from spawning there}}

{{IN|bedrock}}, mobs standing on bottom slabs with air or another bottom slab below fail to pathfind correctly. They often end up spinning around in a small circle when they try to move.

Due to the way blast rays propagate from an [[explosion]], bottom slabs provide extremely effective absorption to explosions directly on top of them.

[[Sneaking]] reduces the [[player]]'s hitbox height to 1.65 blocks {{in|bedrock}}, and so does not allow the player to walk over a bottom slab with one block of [[air]] above it, which is 1.5 blocks of space. {{IN|java}}, however, a crouching player's hitbox is exactly 1.5 blocks, allowing the player to fit through such a gap. A player cannot walk from a block of [[soul sand]] directly up to a bottom slab without jumping – this applies not just to soul sand, but to [[Solid block#Heights|any block]] {{frac|7|8}} of a block high or shorter, because the maximum step height of the player is 0.6 of a block. The player can walk off a bottom slab while sneaking, because the sneaking prevents falling only when the distance is higher than one half block.

If a single slab is placed in a water source block, the empty half of that slab's block is waterlogged. If a slab is placed in flowing water, a pocket of air is created in the unfilled half of the block. If the player's head is in this pocket, the player can breathe and see as clearly as from an air block. If a single slab is placed in between two water sources or waterlogged blocks, the slab will become waterlogged. This also happens when a water bucket or a bucket containing a fish is used on a single slab. Double slabs cannot be waterlogged.

A minecart on powered rails is not repelled by a slab, although it is repelled by a slab with a minecart on top.

Falling block entities (like sand, gravel, and concrete powder) turn into their dropped form if they land on a bottom slab, as when they fall on a torch.

Slabs do not block light {{in|bedrock}}.

=== Fuel ===

Wooden slabs can be used as a fuel in [[furnace]]s, smelting 0.75 items per slab in {{el|je}}, and smelting 1.5 items per slab {{in|be}}.

All had the same properties as stone slabs, apart from using different textures.
|Smooth stone double slabs are obtainable only through [[inventory]] editing, and they use data the data value "4". These slabs are converted into brick slab when upgrading to Beta 1.8.
|The original wooden slabs have to be mined with a [[pickaxe]] to collect, were not affected by [[fire]], and had stronger [[blast resistance]] than [[planks]], making them a useful building material.
|Before the additional slabs were added, a double stone slab would yield only one slab when broken. Since this update, all double slabs now yield 2 of their respective single slabs when broken. Destroying double slabs with [[TNT]], however, still yields only single slabs (when the slabs aren't simply destroyed by the [[explosion]]). It is not known when or if this was fixed.
|Before [[Java Edition Beta 1.3|Beta 1.3]] came out, stone slabs were made with [[cobblestone]] instead of [[stone]], but this update has now introduced cobblestone slabs to the game and changed the recipes for [[pressure plate]]s and stone slabs, so that there wouldn't be any conflicting recipes.}}

== Issues ==

{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==

* Any light directed through a slab does not affect any block's light values north of the source.
* Whereas 1×1 dents in a flat floor using slabs are darkened as one would expect, 1×1 dents created using 2×1 or 2×2 stairs darken less, due to having fewer surrounding solid blocks.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-31503}} resolved as "Works as Intended"</ref>
* When [[water]] or [[lava]] are on top of an upside-down slab, the water dripping particles appear in midair below the slab instead of from the slab itself, this was fixed {{in|java}} [[Java Edition 1.13-pre7|1.13-pre7]],<ref>{{bug|MC-1390}}</ref> but is an intentional feature {{in|bedrock}}.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-32639}}</ref>
*When a [[TNT]] placed on a slab explodes, its blast radius is greatly reduced. ( In some cases, only the slab is destroyed. )
*As with the previous trivia, [[End Crystal|End Crystals]] and [[Creeper]] [[Explosion|explosions]] will also be weakened if the explosion happens on the slab.
